Home folder to separate the respective front and back directories

Back: 'api-memo-test-main'
Front: 'memory_game_test-master'

I hope you find it excellent. I used a very light base of lighthouse but I decided for convenience of understanding to prepare everything well with what I mostly know and train myself even more in lighthouse to be at your service and have the knowledge studied and prepared for whatever you need, I love the idea of to be able to improve myself more and more in a work environment like lighthouse.

In each of the folders, both in the back (in this case the one called "api-memo-test-main), and in the front (memory_game_test-master) you will find the readme to guide you in the development and testing of each one. the parts of this project.

Additionally, also within the @apollo directory files located in node_modules, you will find the necessary documentation to deploy the connection of both servers.

It is even more optimized with lighthouse (which I used a little, but I am wanting to improve it even more to be able to fully form it as a tool in my work environment, I love php and I always like to learn new things in this language).
