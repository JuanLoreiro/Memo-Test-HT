Home folder to separate the respective front and back directories

For all first clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/JuanLoreiro/Memo-Test-HT

Back: 'api-memo-test-main'
Front: 'memory_game_test-master'

I hope you find it excellent. I used a very light base of lighthouse but I decided for convenience of understanding to prepare everything well with what I mostly know and train myself even more in lighthouse to be at your service and have the knowledge studied and prepared for whatever you need, I love the idea of to be able to improve myself more and more in a work environment like lighthouse.

In each of the folders, both in the back (in this case the one called "api-memo-test-main), and in the front (memory_game_test-master) you will find the readme to guide you in the development and testing of each one. the parts of this project.

Additionally, also within the @apollo directory files located in node_modules, you will find the necessary documentation to deploy the connection of both servers.

It is even more optimized with lighthouse (which I used a little, but I am wanting to improve it even more to be able to fully form it as a tool in my work environment, I love php and I always like to learn new things in this language).

The only thing you have to do is run each of the dependencies commands and that's it, the documentation is there to guide you to design and build it as you prefer, just follow the steps that they tell you, whether they are Laravel, apollo, node, next , composer or whatever you want to add!

Enjoy it!
